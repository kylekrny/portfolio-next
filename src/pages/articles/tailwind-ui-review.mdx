Whenever we attempt to work on personal projects, there is always something that overcomes them. Whether it be something with the project like database design, project management, UI / UX, QA, automated testing. Or, itâ€™s all the other demands of life that get in the way of putting in the little bit of time, to see your idea come to life.

When I purchased the Tailwind UI lifetime license for $299.00, I was shooting to remove one thing off my plate. Design. What I ended up doing was streamlining my entire workflow and process.

## What is Tailwind and Tailwind UI

Tailwind CSS is an open-source utility-first css framework that utilizes preprocessors to qllow you to rapidly build components. Aka Instead of having to write tons of css code in order to get your site to look good, it provides a bunch of utility classes such as `flex`, `bg-gray-600` and `rotate-90`.

Tailwind UI is developed by the people who maintain Tailwind CSS, it is a library of prebuilt components and templates that you can use and modify for just about any project you can think of.

**Tailwind UI license does not allow people to build website generators with tailwind UI components, or sell / give away Tailwind UI components other than that though carte blanche.**

## What is included for $299

First, You get access to all their components they have developed. They have a vast component library with everything you need to develop any type of site. Whether you need a pricing component for your marketing site, a dashboard for your app or an checkout page for your e-commerce store their is a component for it.

Second, you get access to their tastefully crafted templates. From API documentation to personal portfolio (what this site is based off), they have you covered. The sites are simple and well built, fully responsive and easy to adjust and make something truly unique. 

## The real value

You are getting tested code written by the people who maintain Tailwind CSS. The way everything just fits, no matter what device you are viewing it on makes the development process move so quickly.

The templates are written in Next.js an intuitive full stack framework that makes it easy to build APIs and other backend functionality into the site. The other beautiful part about utilizing Next.js is how easy it is to containerize. This allows for quick and fast deployments. I currently host my projects using Google Cloud Run allowing my projects to be hosted for pretty much free.

I am not usually the type to help friends out by building a site for them, but with such a quick and simple development process. I have been able to spin up three separate sites all in under a few hours, fully responsive, fully tested and all I had to do was tweak and modify to make it fit their needs.
